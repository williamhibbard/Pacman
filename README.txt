This is a popular project derived from a UC Berkley computer science course.
The bulk of the code was provided, my job was to implement AI concepts to
improve Pacman's performance/ behavior.

General Usage:
You can run the pacman.py file to simply run the pacman environment without
my code dictating Pacman's performance.  There is also an autograder.py file
that grades Pacman's performance based on the provided questions.  Although
I do not have access to the intial questions anymore, the provided environment
should help with usage.
