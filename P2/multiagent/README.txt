Evaluation function for Q5:
  We considered the three most important things: food, capsules, and ghosts.
      The more food there is on the board, the lower the score.  We also lower your score if your average distance
      from food pellets is too high.
      Next are ghosts.  Simply put, being far away from angry ghosts is good, and you get deducted more the closer you
      are (by a small amount).  When ghosts are scared, you are rewarded for getting closer to the point of eating them.
      Lastly, for every pellet left on the board, you are deducted points.  You are rewarded for being next to them, so
      there is incentive to find them and eat them, and then at that point there is incentive to eat the ghosts.
